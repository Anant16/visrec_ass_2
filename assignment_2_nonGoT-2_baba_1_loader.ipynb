    "<br/>The dataset consists of images from 20 classes, with detection annotations included. The JPEGImages folder houses the images, and the Annotations folder has the object-wise labels for the objects in one xml file per image. You have to extract the object information, ie. the [xmin, ymin] (the top left x,y co-ordinates) and the [xmax, ymax] (the bottom right x,y co-ordinates) of only the objects belonging to the given 20 classes(aeroplane, bicycle, boat, bottle, bus, car, cat, chair, cow, dining table, dog, horse, motorbike, person, potted plant, sheep, train, TV). For parsing the xml file, you can import xml.etree.ElementTree for you. <br/>\n",
    "<br/> Organize the data as follows:\n",
    "<br/> For every image in the dataset, extract/crop the object patch from the image one by one using their respective co-ordinates:[xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax], resize the image to resnet_input, and store it with its class label information. Do the same for training/validation and test datasets. <br/>\n",
    "##### Important\n",
    "You also have to collect data for an extra background class which stands for the class of an object which is not a part of any of the 20 classes. For this, you can crop and resize any random patches from an image. A good idea is to extract patches that have low \"intersection over union\" with any object present in the image frame from the 20 Pascal VOC classes. The number of background images should be roughly around those of other class objects' images. Hence the total classes turn out to be 21. This is important for applying the sliding window method later."
